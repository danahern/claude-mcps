  Alif Ensemble E7 device definition for J-Link.

  Install to: ~/Library/Application Support/SEGGER/JLinkDevices/AlifSemi/
  The J-Link DLL recursively scans JLinkDevices/ for *.xml files.

  MRAM at 0x80000000 is memory-mapped and writable via direct loadbin.
  No flash algorithm needed — MRAM doesn't require erase cycles.

  OSPI1 flash at 0xC0000000 (IS25WX512M) uses Ensemble_IS25WX256.FLM
  flash loader. J-Link automatically routes loadbin writes to this
  address range through the flash algorithm (handles erase/program).
  The FLM must be installed separately from Segger's Alif device pack.

  The JLinkScript prevents reset during loadbin — the SE controls
  the boot sequence and resetting via SWD kills AP[3] (M55_HP).
