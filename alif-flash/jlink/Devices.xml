<!--
  Alif Ensemble E7 device definition for J-Link.

  Install to: ~/Library/Application Support/SEGGER/JLinkDevices/AlifSemi/
  The J-Link DLL recursively scans JLinkDevices/ for *.xml files.

  MRAM at 0x80000000 is memory-mapped and writable via direct loadbin.
  No flash algorithm needed — MRAM doesn't require erase cycles.

  The JLinkScript prevents reset during loadbin — the SE controls
  the boot sequence and resetting via SWD kills AP[3] (M55_HP).
